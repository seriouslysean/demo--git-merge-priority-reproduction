## Explanation

2. `main` (`0.1.0`) branch of this repository is updated to `1.11.5` of `dayjs` ("latest" version)
    - [sha](https://github.com/seriouslysean/reproduction-git-merge-priority/commit/50a9394d449359b17c290027182390ee0fc45de9)
3. `hotfix/0.1.1` branch is downgraded to version `1.9.8` of `dayjs` via revert ("old" version)
    - [sha](https://github.com/seriouslysean/reproduction-git-merge-priority/commit/46c8f3900dec7703b4d333d0e5cc972702dfc9cc)
4. `release/0.2.0` branch is upgraded to `1.10.8` of `dayjs` ("bad" version)
5. `release/0.2.0` is downmerged in to `main`, upgrading it to `1.10.8` ("bad" version)
    - [sha](https://github.com/seriouslysean/reproduction-git-merge-priority/commit/8ba09f36be3662ae22922afa6ec8ee3a56596f68)
6. `hotfix/0.1.1` is downmerged to `release/0.2.0`
    - [There is a conflict of the project version but not the package version](#hotfix011-merge-conflict)
    - The `1.9.8` update is skipped because the change is now older
    - [sha](https://github.com/seriouslysean/reproduction-git-merge-priority/commit/6d45af50f10d9511ffa941fe097f14d6976f4a2d)
7. `release/0.2.0` is downmerged to `main`
    - The merge is successful
    - The "bad" version is kept because it is technically newer than the previous revert
    - [sha](https://github.com/seriouslysean/reproduction-git-merge-priority/commit/14434cd35559f7040506aef6267edcba1efb95c4)
